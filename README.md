Project Description

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data (SGH Database). The project explores booking behavior, customer trends, revenue optimization, and operational efficiency using data-driven insights.

The notebook walks through multiple aspects of the dataset, including:

Booking Patterns – seasonal trends, peak months, and booking surges.

Lead Time Analysis – how booking lead times vary across distribution channels and customer types.

Customer Behavior – segmentation by customer type and booking channels.

Cancellation Analysis – understanding factors driving cancellations.

Revenue Insights – ADR (Average Daily Rate) and revenue contribution by country/distribution channel.

Geographical Trends – which markets contribute the most to bookings.

Operational Insights – deposit types, corporate bookings, and staffing implications.

Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis and visualization
